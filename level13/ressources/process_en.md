1. In the home directory, there is an executable that checks if the user has ID 4242.
2. If the user has ID 4242, the program transforms a string of characters stored in memory and displays it. Otherwise, the program exits.
3. Since the user 4242 does not exist, run the program in a debugger called Cutter.
4. Place a breakpoint on the comparison and run the program.
5. Once the breakpoint is reached, modify eax, which has the value of the local uid, to 4242.
6. Continue the program's execution and the program will compare 4242 with 4242 and then continue normally to display the flag, allowing you to connect to level14.
