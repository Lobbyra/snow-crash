Display the file /etc/passwd.
Notice that the flag01 account has its hash displayed.
I put the account and hash into the crack.txt file.
I installed John the Ripper and tried its default password dictionary.
JtR found that the password abcdefg matched with the hash.
I was able to log in to the flag01 account with this password.
Run getflag.
